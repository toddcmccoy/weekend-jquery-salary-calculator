# Employee Salary Calculator


## Description

_Duration: 15 Hours_

This project is designed to help an employer keep track of their employees' salaries and the employer's monthly salary payroll obligation.

The employer enters the employee information into the input fields and the entered information is diplayed on the page. The program is currently set to show "red" or over budget if the employer's total monthly obligation reaches $20,000 or more. That number can be adjusted as a company grows.

Should an employee be terminated or otherwise depart the company the employer need only click "Remove Employee" to delete that employees information.
